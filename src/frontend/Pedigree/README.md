What if pedigree was a one time fetch? I ONLY update the pedigree document when clicking save

I can't keep local nodes dumb. Each node has to be associated with a whale to display the name and whaleId

Whales each need an "identifier" column which Chloe will fill in herself

Things I HAVE to do
* I have to grab the pedigree (and nodes) first on the pedigree page
* I then have to parse through each node and grab the whale information
* I should just store the pedigree with its non-node data
