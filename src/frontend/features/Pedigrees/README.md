Brainstorm:

- I think I should make any edits to the pedigree local until "save" is pushed
- The three types of modification are adding new nodes, node position, and node details
- DON'T worry about edges for now

* When a node is added, it should be added to the local node state array
    - Currently this is the case, setNodes is used to add the new node "onDrop"
* When a node's position is changed, it should be modified in the node state array
    - Currently this is the case, setNodes updated to reflect the dragged node in question
* When a whale's name is changed, it should be modified locally on the node
