      “A public repository of information on an endangered population of killer
      whales resident to the coastal eastern North Pacific Ocean, the Southern
      Residents. Subject to ongoing monitoring since 1976, Southern Resident
      killer whales (currently numbering just 75 living animals) are severely
      impacted by anthropogenic activity, including reduction of their preferred
      prey, severe chemical and acoustic pollution, and historical captures for
      the aquarium industry. Synthesizing census information from multiple
      sources in a succinct, engaging format, this website enables full
      visualization of the decline of this icon of the Pacific Northwest like
      never before, emphasizing the need for immediate and sweeping conservation
      action.”
